&lt;p>Recently I spun up a cloud machine where I run a Beelzebub honeypot to collect IOCs, attack types, malware samples, etc., and I was having some difficulty dealing with log files to see the big picture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I decided to create a project to increase the observability, efficiency, and visualization for the log files. This way, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see the big picture, filter through logs easily, search for IP addresses and their reputations from some common threat intelligence feeds, and more.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
