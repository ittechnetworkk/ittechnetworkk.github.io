&lt;p>Recently I spun up a cloud machine where I run a Beelzebub honeypot to collect IOCs, attack types, malware samples, etc., and I was having some difficulty dealing with log files to see the big picture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I decided to create a project to increase the observability, efficiency, and visualization for the log files. This way, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see the big picture, filter through logs easily, search for IP addresses and their reputations from some common threat intelligence feeds, and more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[EN] A Honeypot Story</title><link>https://ittechnetworkk.github.io/posts/ahoneypotstory/a-honeypot-story/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 10:36:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ittechnetworkk.github.io/posts/ahoneypotstory/a-honeypot-story/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi everyone. In this article, I’ll walk you through my research on an AI-powered honeypot project that I deployed in the cloud to observe various attacker Tactic and Technics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I built a honeypot in a cloud environment using &lt;a href="https://beelzebub.ai/">Beelzebub&lt;/a>, an AI-supported honeypot, to evaluate how effective it is—and it performed very well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before AI honeypots, you typically had two choices: convert a real machine into a honeypot (very effective but risky), or deploy traditional honeypots (safer but easier for attackers to detect). The core idea of a honeypot is to imitate a real system inside or outside your network so you can observe malicious behavior and act before a real breach occurs. However, depending on your network configuration, attackers may still identify the deception. If you allow outbound internet access, an attacker might leverage it for malicious activity that could harm your organization’s reputation. If you don’t allow outbound access, you either need to simulate realistic responses or accept that the system may be exposed as a honeypot.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[EN] Security Operation Center Setup</title><link>https://ittechnetworkk.github.io/posts/securityoperationcenterinstallation/security-operation-center-installation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 15:38:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ittechnetworkk.github.io/posts/securityoperationcenterinstallation/security-operation-center-installation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi everyone! In this article, I will take you through my Security Operation Center environment on Hetzner, which is a German company that provides web hosting services and data centers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to start by sharing my excitement with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been interested in IT for some time and have built several lab environments, ranging from small to large. After gaining experience, I wanted to build my own SOC environment to gain more real-life experience.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
